## Challenges & Afterthought

Most challenges is how to find the Bootstrap tags, making sure I dont miss-spell any 'class' name.
One small mistake could lead to lots of code wont work fully.

Using Bootstrap save me lots of time, there are lots of pre-made templetes available online, I just need to change it to the way I like.
